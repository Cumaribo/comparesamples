#It  returns maps for each one of the thresholds between 70 and 100%. The next step is to load this, stack cut it by pieces and then carry out the comparson betwee nthe maps. Everything trough maps.

#of course, you can run a comparison between any given pair of years for your study period, they donÂ´t need to be consecutive. 
#CompareClassification produces a list with three objects.
# 1. A raster with the changes. The pixel values range from  1 to 4; 1. stands for class 1 that remained the same, 2 and 3 changes 
# in one way or another and 4 is class two remained the same. Yo can export it with writeraster
# 2. A square contingency table that tells you the difference between the pair of maps numerically. it's like a confusion matrix
# but it discloses the level of agreemwnt between both maps and how many pixles were gsined/lost for each class.
# The kappa bwtween the two maps. It is supposed to represent the overall level of agreement between the two maps.
# however, as it does not tell where these pixels are, or to which class they belong, some authors do not recommend using it
# for more information, check https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco_Millones/publication/233196329_Death_to_Kappa_Birth_of_quantity_disagreement_and_allocation_disagreement_for_accuracy_assessment/links/0deec531e1ea538616000000.pdf

#this plots an agrerement map between each pai of maps, showing what pixels remained the same, and for the ones that changed
